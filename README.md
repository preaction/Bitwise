# Bitwise Game Development Framework

Bitwise is a game development framework written in *TypeScript*
targeting *WebGL*. The framework comes with a GUI-based editor for
managing game assets and assembling scenes.

The goal of the project is to provide an extensible base to build games
of any size and be able to release them on multiple platforms. For now,
the focus is on 2D games for the web.
